# Hi there

My name is John Yucel. First off, I need to give all credit for this website to Ed Hinrichsen. I did not design this but I absolutelty love this website. I'm gonna try to build off his website to the best of my ability. He's extremely talented so it will definetly be hard.

Anyways, I'm a Virginia Tech Graduate, who likes playing around with all things tech. I'm trying my best to make a cool website to show off some of my personal projects.

Type "cd ~/projects" then "ls" to see details of some of the projects I have worked on recently. Again, all credit to Ed Hinrichsen for the code and design.
